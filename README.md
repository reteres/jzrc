　　当出书界被某些人吞噬，她们就会“歌颂”咱们的年青读者群，她们赚更多的钱，当培养界被某些人吞噬，她们就会“歌颂”咱们的下一代，她们的看法却是阻挡置疑。当书院被某些人吞噬，她们就会“歌颂”咱们的弟子--此时不博，更待何时，择校费然而几万罢了。当羊奶行业被某些人吞噬，她们就会“歌颂”咱们的青妙龄，蓄意她们身材更壮。之上的例子然而是九牛一毛。
	7、宽恕不能改变过去，但能拓宽未来。
　　我为哥哥祈祷，愿他早日能拿到这笔工程款。
In the farmers are visible, but all in high spirits, care about the head.
The day high air, light, less hot, much cooler, looked at the ground golden, covered with branches, boughs skeletons of maize syrup with rows of golden teeth, full of millet bead people stare big eyes waiting for harvest, pieces of cotton as the snow fell in the field;
High hong liang, chrysanthemum opened, and the farmer smiled.
For a good harvest, why not call a person cheerful.
22, some road, just know hard;
After some things, and they knew that experience.
They see some people, and they knew that experience.
For the rest of my life, just know happiness.
